# Image-Filtering
In this Project I have tried to explore and identify various filtering techniques to enhance our image.

The Mean filtered image shows that noisiness has been reduced, but there are some marks now which were not present in the image before.To eradicate that Grayscale has beeend used.
By gray scale filter the marks cannot be seen anymore, however, image smoothness has been reduced to great effect.To nullify this,a different filter was used.
Gaussian Filtering shows quite a good effect to our sample image.
To see if better results can be obtained,Median filtering method has next been tried.
As our final observation,it is observed that the median filter has removed the noisiness and retained the edges while being converted to a grayscale image.
